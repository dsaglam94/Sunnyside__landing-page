### Built with

### About me

Hello guys! 

This project was fairly easy but yet some parts were a little bit challenging. I loved the design overall and wanted to give it some personal touches that normally design didn't have. (e.g hover styles & menu bar)

I used SCSS and BEM name convention as usual. It becomes much easier to organize your work with SCSS so I will continue with SCSS for a while.
